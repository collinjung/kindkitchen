# Treehacks 2024 Project: [OpenPlate]
Project built by Evelyn Hur, Collin Jung, Susan Lee, Belinda Yeung

**What is OpenPlate?**
Being unable to find specialized food and recipes based on individual dietary restrictions and preferences is a pressing issue for those undergoing medical treatments and procedures. With OpenPlate, we hope to bridge the gap between families with an extra plate after preparing meals and patients who just need a nice, homecooked meal.
